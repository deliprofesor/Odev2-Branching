# Water Pollution and Disease Analysis

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32b72e4b-06a7-4412-8c72-096c863ae4bd)


This project focuses on analyzing water pollution data and its relationship with diseases. It includes visualizations, correlation analysis, and machine learning models for predicting disease rates based on water quality features.

## Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - The data is loaded from a CSV file (`water_pollution_disease.csv`).
   - Missing values are handled by replacing numerical missing values with the mean and categorical missing values with the mode.

2. **Correlation Analysis**
   - A heatmap is generated to visualize the correlation matrix of numerical features.

3. **Water Pollution and Disease Relationship**
   - A pairplot is created to visualize the relationship between water pollution levels and disease rates (e.g., diarrhea, cholera, and typhoid).

4. **Time-Series Analysis**
   - A line plot visualizes the diarrhea rates across different years for different countries.

5. **Feature Selection and Model Preparation**
   - Features related to water pollution (e.g., contaminant levels, pH, turbidity, etc.) are selected.
   - The target variable is the diarrhea rate.

6. **Random Forest Model**
   - A Random Forest Regressor is used to predict the diarrhea rate based on selected features.
   - The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

7. **K-means Clustering**
   - K-means clustering is applied to segment the data into clusters based on water pollution levels.
   - The clustering results are visualized using a scatter plot, showing how different pollutants cluster together.

8. **Cluster Centroids Visualization**
   - A plot is created to show the centroids of the clusters generated by K-means.
